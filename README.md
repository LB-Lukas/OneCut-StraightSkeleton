 # **OneStraightCut**

OneStraightCut is a computational origami project that implements the "One Cut Theorem" using CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library). This theorem enables cutting any straight-line drawing from a piece of paper using a single straight cut.

## **Features**
- **Straight Skeleton Computation**: Generate the straight skeleton from a planar graph.
- **Cut Graph Calculation**: Use computational geometry to create precise fold patterns.
- **Integration with CGAL**: Built with CGAL 6.0.1 for robust and accurate geometry operations.
